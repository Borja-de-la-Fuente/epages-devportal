Until a little over a year ago, for most of us, videoconferencing was limited to a few occasions when it was necessary to speak with members of other teams who were not in the same building or someone was doing home office. However, with the current situation with COVID-19, more and more people work from home or who, for different reasons, must hold meetings with members of their own team or other teams who are working from their homes. 
This has made video conferencing platforms an essential tool.

Some months ago at ePages we have started to use the MICROSOFT TEAMS tool, which allows us to hold meetings of more than 70 people without problems, generate different rooms that will work simultaneously, chat in each of them, â€¦ However, it is not the only option and today there are more options, some of which are being used by other teams. In this blogpost we will talk about several of those options, commenting on their characteristics and the experiences we have had.

During the first months of 2020, an application that quickly gained popularity and users was ZOOM. However, its version for Linux was far from being its priority and there were doubts about its security, which made us discard it as a viable option.

## BBB Big Blue Button
A very widespread platform that all of us use every week is BBB (BigBlueButton). It is an open source tool based on Linux, which allows videoconferences, which we can record and has a chat where you can write. However, due to the need for a physical server in the office, when we started using it there were problems with meetings that were interrupted or running slowly. For the most part, to this day, these problems have been solved. However, some of them still persist for those teams working outside of Germany, as conferences constantly suffer from audio or video problems, which can only be fixed if the person creating the room is in Germany. These problems have been the ones that at the time encouraged us to seek other options.

## Hangout and Meet
Among these options, one that until recently was one of the most used was HANGOUT, which had a very simple interface to use, including a chat in each room and which allowed more than one user to share a screen simultaneously. At this last point, there was a loss of quality when changing the element that was being shared for a few seconds, not being a problem, but rather annoying. In any case, this platform is no longer maintained by Google for the benefit of MEET (It will disappear in June 2021).

## Microsoft Teams VS Meet
If there are two tools that can currently cover our needs for the home office or online meetings, these are, today, GOOGLE MEET and MICROSOFT TEAMS. In both cases, these are platforms that allow us to create conferences that seamlessly support large volumes of users simultaneously, since they are based on the cloud, they give us the option to share screen (1 at the same time), they have channels chat rooms in each room, have the option of subtitling in real time, for conversations in English and have a web version, as was the case with the other tools mentioned above. This, in principle, could give us the impression that both options are equally good. However, there are small nuances that determine its use in one team or another, instead of being a mere choice of personal taste. The determining factor for this choice is the Operating System (OS).

We can see these small details more clearly among LINUX users, compared to WINDOWS and MAC users. One of the functionalities that both share is to be able to personalize, as much as we see ourselves in the conversation using photos to put in the background, as well as the way in which we configure the distribution of the meeting participants (see only one, all to the time, ...). In the first case, we will not have the background change available in LINUX and when it comes to seeing participants, only four can be seen (in the web version it will be reduced to one), the rest of the options we will lose, compared to this program for the other two OS. The same is true for the subtitles option. This makes it difficult to have a conversation when there are more than 4 participants at the same time and can interfere with communication.
On the other hand, with MEET, there is no difference between its versions for LINUX, MAC, WINDOWS or the web application. This is a clear advantage that can lead teams that work mostly with LINUX to use the application, since it ensures that all members will have the same tools. The only downside we could make is that in order to use it, you need to have a Google ePages account.

## What is the best option?
In conclusion, we could say that the use of one platform or another may be directly related to the operating system that we use and that we want to get the most out of it. At the same time, BigBlueButton is still another perfectly viable option for those teams working from Germany, thanks to the fact that the problems that were in the beginning have already been solved.

## Thank you for all the support received by transmitting your experience with all these video platforms.
