Until a little over a year ago, for most of us, participating in video conferences was limited to a few occasions.
Sometimes it was necessary to speak with members of other teams who are located in a different office or if someone was doing home office.
However, the current situation with COVID-19 required some substantial changes. 
Now the majority is working from home but Meetings are still necessary.
Maybe even more necessary than before to stay in touch with you colleagues. 
This made video conferencing platforms essential for us.

Some months ago, at ePages we’ve started to use the tool Microsoft Teams, which allows us to hold meetings with more than 70 people, generate different rooms that can be used simultaneously, chat with each other, … 
However, Microsoft Teams wasn’t the only option. 
Today, we use a variety of different video platform tools within the company depending on which each team prefer.
In this blog post we will talk about several of those options, commenting on their characteristics and the experiences we have had.

## Starting the journey

Some months ago, at ePages we’ve started to use the tool Microsoft Teams, which allows us to hold meetings with more than 70 people, generate different rooms that can be used simultaneously, chat with each other, … 
However, Microsoft Teams wasn’t the only option. 
Today, we use a variety of different video platform tools within the company depending on which each team prefer.

During the first months of 2020, one application in particular quite quickly gained popularity and users - ZOOM.
We also thought about using it but there were some issues. 
At ePages everyone can freely choose what system they want to work with.
For some developers Linux is the best choice. However, the Zoom version for Linux doesn’t seem to be a priority for them which made us discard it as a viable option. 
No to mention the doubts about the security. 

One tool that a lot of us use every week and some even every day is BBB (BigBlueButton).
It is an open-source tool based on Linux.
There we can hold videoconferences, record them, and the tool also provides a chat.
However, due to the need for a physical server in the office, when we started using it there were problems with meetings that were interrupted or running slowly.
For the most part, we were able to solve these problems.
But some of them still persist.
Especially, for teams working outside of Germany, there are still some or video problems.
The only solution we found is that the conference room is created by a person in Germany.
Not ideal for our teams outside of Germany, therefore we were encouraged to seek for different options for them.
However, for a lot of teams at ePages it’s still the best option.
We also use it for most of the reviews in the RnD-Department.

## Looking for different options

One of the options, that we used most was Hangout.
It has a very simple interface to use, including a chat in each room and even allowed more than one user to share their screen simultaneously.
However, there was always a small moment where the image quality was lacking.
If the person who is sharing their screen changes the element the image quality lacked only for a few seconds, not a big problem but rather annoying.
Since, the platform is also no longer maintained by Google for the benefit of Meet we also stopped using it (It will disappear in June 2021).

The two tools we’ve found that cover our needs best are Google Meet and Microsoft Teams.
Both platforms allow us to create conferences with a big group of people, sharing a screen (however only one at a time), chats in each room, the option of automatic subtitling for conversations in English and a web version.
This gives us the impression that both options are equally good at fulfilling our needs.
However, there are small nuances that differ which determine the functionality for each person.
It’s not mere a choice of personal taste. 
The determining factor is the Operating System (OS).

## And the winner is…

One of the functionalities that both share is to be able to personalize, as much as we see ourselves in the conversation using photos to put in the background, as well as the way in which we configure the distribution of the meeting participants (see only one, all to the time, ...). 
However, in Microsoft Teams, for Linux users some of these features aren’t available at all or only in a reduced form. 
First of all, you can’t change the background. 
But which is even worse, you can’t see all the participants at once.
Instead, you can only see four and in the web version it is even reduced to one. 
In comparison to the other operating systems there are some more features missing like the subtitles option.
Google Meet doesn’t have these huge differences between its versions for Linux, Mac and Windows or if you are using the web application.
This is a clear advantage and makes Google Meet the overall winner of this little comparison.
However, there is also a downside. 
In order to use it, everybody needs its own Google account.

## Conclusion

Picking the best video conference tool really depends on the individual needs and circumstances like location of the different users and the variety of used operation systems. 
In conclusion, we could say that for us a mix of different tools is the best choice for now.
This way every team can use what works best for them. 
However, the goal should be to minimize the variety as much as possible. 
Too many different tools could complicate the work with other teams and affect the overall communication within the company.
Especially if the majority works from home, an eased communication is very much needed.

### Thanks to all of my colleagues for the support by transmitting your experience with all these video platforms.
