Until a little over a year ago, for most of us, participating in video conferences was limited to a few occasions.
Sometimes it was necessary to speak with colleagues in a different location or when someone was working from home.
However, the current situation with COVID-19 required some substantial changes. 
Now, the majority is working from home but Meetings are still a necessity.
Maybe, they have become even more important to stay in touch with colleagues. 
This made video conferencing platforms essential for our everyday work.

## Starting the journey

Some months ago, we've started to use [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software){:target="_blank"}which allows us to hold meetings with more than 70 people, generate different rooms that can be used simultaneously, chat with each other, … 
However, Microsoft Teams isn't the only option. 
Today, we use a variety of different video platforms within the company depending on the needs and personal preferences of each team.
In this blog post, I'll talk about some of these options. comment on their characteristics, and explain why we haven't found or go-to yet.

During the first months of 2020, one application in particular quite quickly gained popularity and users - [ZOOM](https://zoom.us/){:target="_blank"}.
We also thought about using it but there were some issues. 
At ePages, everyone can freely decide what operating system they want to work with.
For some developers, Linux is the best option.
However, there were some bigger differences regarding the range of functions between Windows/Mac and Linux.
That's why we discarded it as a viable option. 
No to mention the [doubts about the security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7hIrw1BUck){:target="_blank"}. 

One tool that a lot of us use every week and some even every day is [BBB (BigBlueButton)](https://bigbluebutton.org/){:target="_blank"}.
It is an open-source tool based on Linux for video conferences.
However, you can also record them and the tool provides a chat.
Due to the need for a physical server in the office, when we started using it, we had some problems with interruptions and slowly running meetings. 
We were able to solve most of these problems but some of them persist.
Especially, for teams working outside of Germany, there are still some problems with the video.
The only solution we found is that the conference room is created by a person in Germany.
Not ideal, therefore we were encouraged to seek different options.
However, for a lot of teams at ePages BBB is still the go-to platform.
We also use it for most of the reviews in the RnD-Department.

## Looking for different options

One of the options we used most was [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/){:target="_blank"}.
It has a very simple interface to use, includes a chat in each room and even allows more than one user to share their screen simultaneously.
However, there is one issue.
When the person who is sharing the screen changes the element the image quality always lacks. 
Only for a few seconds so not a big problem but rather annoying.
Since the platform is also no longer maintained by Google for the benefit of Google Meet, we stopped using it (It will disappear completely in June 2021).

The two tools we’ve found that cover our needs best are [Google Meet](https://apps.google.com/meet/){:target="_blank"} and Microsoft Teams.
Both platforms allow us to create conferences with a big group of people, to share a screen (however only one at a time), to chat in each room, automatic subtitles for conversations in English, and both are providing a web version.
This could give us the impression that both options are equally good at fulfilling our needs.
However, there are small nuances that differ which determine the functionality.
It’s not mere a choice of personal taste. 
The determining factor is the Operating System (OS).

## And the winner is…

Some of the functionalities both share are the option to see ourselves in the meeting, change the background to a photo, configure the distribution of the meeting participants on the screen (see only one/see all), ...
However, in Microsoft Teams, for Linux users, some of these features aren’t available at all or only in a reduced form. 
First of all, you can’t change the background. 
But which is even worse, you can’t see all participants at once.
Instead, you can only see four and in the web version it is even reduced to one.
In comparison to the other operating systems, some more features are missing e. g. the subtitles option.
Google Meet doesn’t have these huge differences between its versions for Linux, Mac and Windows or if you are using the web application.
This is a clear advantage and makes Google Meet the overall winner of this little comparison.
However, there is also a downside. 
In order to use it, everyone needs its own Google account.

## Conclusion

Picking the best video conference tool depends on the individual needs and circumstances.
For us, the main factors are the location of different users, since we are working across different nations, and the variety of used operating systems. 
That's why a mix of different video conferencing platforms is the best choice for now.
This way every team can use what works best for them. 
However, the goal should be to minimize the variety as much as possible. 
Too many different tools could complicate the work with other teams and affect the overall communication within the company.
Especially if the majority works from home, an eased communication is very much needed.

### Thanks to all of my colleagues for the support by transmitting your experience with all these video platforms.
